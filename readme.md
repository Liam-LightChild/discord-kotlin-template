## Running the bot

[Make sure you rewrite this section!]

This template requires the `BOT_TOKEN` environment variable to be set to the Discord-provided bot token.
Kord will use this to connect to Discord and interact with its APIs. It also requires the `GUILD_ID`
environment variable, which must contain the id of the guild that the bot is added to. This is very
useful for testing, as Discord likes to cache global commands for an hour, making them take a while to
update.
